# Debol-Car-Pricing-Analysis

Debol Ecommerce, a company with a
significant presence in the automotive industry
and specialization in the sale of cars from
multiple brands, has been operational for a
considerable duration. The company has
encountered some challenges, prompting them
to seek ways to enhance their processes.
Specifically, they have recognized the need to
improve their understanding of vehicle
valuation, a crucial factor in determining the
worth of cars sold, to better serve their
customers and boost productivity.
Debol ecommerce company approached
us as a data consulting firm with the goal of
developing a model that can accurately
predict the price of a car based on various
factors such as make, model, year, price,
kms_driven, and fuel_type.
This model will provide customers with a
better understanding of their vehicle's worth,
thus allowing them to make more informed
decisions when selling their car to other
customers.
